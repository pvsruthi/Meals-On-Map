	<p><b> Why Meals On Map is Different</b></p>
	<p>Any restaurant in the localities pre-package their food and store them in low temerature, making it really risky to have an order delivered,finally which are loaded onto trucks and dropped at the recipient's door. Once they finally get inside, the food may be dehydrated and not fresh. But a Meals On Map order is different. At Meals On Map, we know that a truly exceptional order of food relies on the expertise of a everyday cook. All of our dishes/meals are hand cooked by a local provider using only the freshest vegetables available, and each order is personally taken care, to see that the customer has all his requiremrents satisfied, ready to be enjoyed immediately.</p>
